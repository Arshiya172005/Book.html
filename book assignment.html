    <p2>Books have this power of dragging us from reality and throwing us into the world of imagination. One such book that has blown my mind away is 'The Hunger Games' by Suzanne Collins. This book is the first novel of 'The Hunger Games' trilogy. Written in the voice of Katniss Everdeen, it drives us to the future where THE CAPITOL has this whole control and power over the nation. From how an older sister protects her little sister and keeps the promise of trying hard to win the game, the story grip kept me turning on the pages.</p2>

        <p3>The book which I found to be very interesting was "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" by Jeff Kinney. I had Always found it entertaining and it really speaks to me. I have read almost all sorts of books, however I always come back to this one. This book is just so funny that my mind couldn’t distract in any way. I don’t know weather the book is about comedy or adventure but truly conquers my mind towards it. Personally, for me this book brings back so many memories when I used to play with my friends all the time. There are a number of great characters who make the story wild, but the one star that I love is of course the main character named Greggory. I read the first page and I knew this reading experience was going to be something special. </p3>

        <p4>Harry Potter movies are the most favorite movies of all time for me since my childhood. Once I watched Harry Potter, first movie, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I was obsessed with it and couldn't stop watching the other episodes. Honestly, my childhood was profoundly influenced by the world of Harry Potter.  Role-playing as a cast in Harry Potter movies, debating which Hogwarts house we belonged to, and shouting out magic spells to each other, with my friends, were the best fun and indelible memories of my childhood. </p4>
